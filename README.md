Game Logic:

You need to avoid the red balls that are falling from the top. If you collide with a red ball, it's game over. 
However, if you catch a blue ball, your handler will be shorter by 50% for 5 seconds, which will help you avoid the red balls easily during that time.


Future Possible Implementation:

Optimize the level progression to ensure a smoother and more balanced increase in difficulty.
Add more falling items (stuffs) that provide various benefits when caught, such as:
   - Speed Boost
   - Score Multiplier
   - Temporary Invincibility
   - .. and more different beneficial things for the players.
